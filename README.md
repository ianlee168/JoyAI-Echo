## Abstract

Long video generation still suffers from error accumulation, weak temporal coherence, and prohibitive latency, limiting its applicability to interactive scenarios. We present **JoyAI-Echo**, a framework that breaks these barriers through four key advances.
Central to its performance, a cross-modal audio-visual memory bank preserves character appearance and voice timbre consistently over five-minute videos, while a post-training pipeline combines memory-based reinforcement learning with distribution matching distillation for a **7.5× speedup** to substantially boost visual quality and alignment.
Empowered by these two components, **JoyAI-Echo** decisively outperforms *HappyOyster* (directing mode) on long-form generation and even surpasses the short-video specialist *Wan 2.6* on human-centric tasks.
Beyond raw generation quality, an interactive agent enables real-time user editing through conversational instructions, and a lightweight super-resolution module maintains high definition under streaming latency, further elevating the overall experience and delivering instantly editable, conversation-speed video creation.
For the first time, **JoyAI-Echo** simultaneously achieves long-range cross-modal consistency, real-time inference for minute-long video, conversational interactivity, and high-resolution output — without compromise, inaugurating a new era of interactive video generation.
Codes and weights will be open-sourced.

## Highlights

- 🎞️ **Minute-level multi-shot stories**: generate a sequence of coherent shots from one prompt JSON.
- ⚡ **DMD-distilled few-step inference**: ~7.5x faster than the original pipeline.
- 🔊 **Joint audio-video generation**: one pipeline produces synchronized video and audio.
- 🧠 **Paired cross-modal memory bank**: conditions each new shot on prior visual identity and voice context for story-level consistency.

```

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone

```bash

git clone https://github.com/jd-opensource/JoyAI-Echo.git
cd JoyAI-Echo
```

### 2. Create the environment

The reference environment is **Python 3.11 + PyTorch 2.8 + CUDA 12.8**.

With conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate echo-long
```

With `uv`:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128 -r requirements.txt
```

[`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) must be available on `PATH` for shot concatenation. The conda recipe includes it. If you use `uv`, install it with your system package manager:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
# macOS:
brew install ffmpeg
```

### 3. Download checkpoint

Download the JoyAI-Echo release checkpoint and Gemma text encoder:

| File | Description | Size |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `echo-longvideo-release.safetensors` | Full model (transformer + VAE + vocoder) | ~46 GB |
| `gemma-3-12b/` | Instruction-tuned model (text encoder) | ~24 GB |

Place them under `checkpoints/`:

```text
checkpoints/
+-- echo-longvideo-release.safetensors
`-- gemma-3-12b/
```

Download links:

- JoyAI-Echo release checkpoint: [`jdopensource/JoyAI-Echo`](https://huggingface.co/jdopensource/JoyAI-Echo)
- Gemma 3 12B text-encoder: [`google/gemma-3-12b-it`](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-12b-it) — instruction-tuned multimodal variant (requires accepting Google's license on HuggingFace)

```bash
export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
huggingface-cli download --resume-download google/gemma-3-12b-it \
  --local-dir checkpoints/gemma-3-12b
```

### 4. Write a story prompt

Create a JSON file under `prompts/`. Each string is one complete shot description.

```json
{
  "prompts": [
    "A nurse prepares a vaccine syringe with calm precision before administering it to a smiling child.",
    "The camera cuts to the child's relieved parent, softly lit by a clinic window.",
    "The scene ends with the nurse updating the record while the child waves goodbye."
  ]
}
```

A single prompt creates a single shot. Multiple prompts create a multi-shot story conditioned through the paired audio-video memory bank.

### 5. Run inference

```bash
python inference.py
```

This loads the model once and processes all prompt files under `prompts/`.

> 💡 **Note**: The inference pipeline is optimized to run on lower-VRAM
> GPUs. Peak GPU usage is around **46–50 GB**, at the cost of slightly
> longer per-shot inference time.

Outputs are written to:

```text
inference_result/outputs/<prompt-name>/inference_<timestamp>/
```

## Configuration

All inference parameters are managed in `configs/inference.yaml`. The file is organized into sections:

| Section | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `paths` | Checkpoint path, prompts directory, output root |
| `video` | Resolution, frame count, FPS, seed |
| `denoising` | Step list and sigma schedule |
| `memory` | Memory bank size, save mode, LoRA settings |
| `audio_memory` | Audio window, mel-spectrogram params |
| `inference` | Device, dtype, grad scale |

### Override via CLI

Any YAML parameter can be overridden from the command line:

```bash
python inference.py --seed 42 --num-frames 121 --video-height 480 --video-width 832
```

Use a custom config file:

```bash
python inference.py --config configs/my_experiment.yaml
```

The Python entrypoint exposes the full configuration surface:

```bash
python inference.py --help
```

## Hardware

Peak GPU usage is around **46–50 GB** for the default **25 fps x 241 frames x 1280 x 736** setting, so a single H100/A100-class (80 GB) or 48 GB GPU is sufficient.

For smaller GPUs, reduce resolution/frames:

```bash
python inference.py --num-frames 121 --video-height 480 --video-width 832
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| 🎧 `ffmpeg: command not found` | Install [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or use the conda environment. |
| 🧩 Checkpoint path errors | Verify `checkpoints/echo-longvideo-release.safetensors` exists, or set `paths.checkpoint` in YAML. |
| 🔥 CUDA out of memory | Lower `num_frames`, `height`, or `width` via CLI flags. |
| ⚙️ Import errors | Run from the repo root (`python inference.py`); the script auto-configures `sys.path`. |
